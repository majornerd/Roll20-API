This video shows how to create an API script that summons a spiritual weapon token onto the battlefield, gives it an aura, assigns it to be under a particular player's control, and gives off a burst of holy light. Note - the script is expecting that the token will only be controllable by one player (Thanks for pointing that out, Scotty). So if your token can be controlled by more than one person, an error will be thrown. This video addresses that - https://youtu.be/OvVT9ZKtjcI so check it out after you go through this one.

If you'd rather just run the script, you can find the code here. https://gist.github.com/nolivo/42d04f... Note that you do need to change the imgsrc line to the URL of an image you have in your library. The video talks a bit about this image starting at 00:00:42.
